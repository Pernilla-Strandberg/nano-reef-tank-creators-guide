# Nano Reef Tank Creator's Guide

This guide is for people who want to start a nano reef tank but don't really dare due to lack of experience or because they find it too complicated. There are many guides on the web that are perceived as very heavy, which means that you easily lose interest. This guide will remedy that by simply describing how to do it in the most efficient and easy ways.

Over time, if more people start to get involved in saltwater aquarism, it could help to save the endangered reefs from extinction by taking care of the creatures that live there right now.
